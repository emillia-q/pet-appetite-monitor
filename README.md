# Pet Appetite Monitor

## Project Origins
This handsome gentleman is Zefir.
//TODO: add the photo of cat
We've known each other for 15 years, which is more than half of my life. 
Recently, he was unfortunately diagnosed with intestinal lymphoma. 
A crucial part of his care involves monitoring his food intake, both daily and weekly, to track his appetite and overall well-being.
This need became the inspiration for this project and unfortunately the only way I can help him. Its primary purpose is to precisely monitor and record the time and quantity of his meals, providing critical data to help manage his condition.
